## üíª Project Structure

The key components of the project are:

* **`Pages/`:** Contains the Razor Pages (`.cshtml` and `.cshtml.cs` files) that handle the UI and page-specific logic, including the main chat page.
* **`Data/`:** Holds the **`DbContext`** and **`Message`** entity/model used by Entity Framework Core to interact with the database for saving and retrieving chat history.
* **`Hubs/`:** Contains the **`ChatHub.cs`** class, which is the central **SignalR Hub** that manages real-time connections and message broadcasting.
* **`wwwroot/js/`:** Includes the client-side JavaScript that establishes the SignalR connection, sends messages, and handles the live appending of new messages to the chat window.
